# AutoGrader
 
## Hooray, Marking Hell is Finally Over!
#
 
## About:
 
#### AutoGrader is a simple, command line driven tool that takes away all the stress and agony of marking papers away for good.

#### *At last! You can relax again!*
 
#### Simply open the command line, run the script and get back to what you *really* *want* to be doing with your life, like knitting, starting to smoke cigarettes at age 46, and even contemplating the meaning of your own mortality given the chaotic and inherently meaningless nature of the universe! 
#

* Autograder marks on a bell curve. 
    It progressively skews lower grades higher
    to help avoid crying students during office hours. 

* please note, in Autograder v1.0, on occasion, a grade is listed as 'undefined', in that case, the folks here at Autograder *strongly* encourage giving this student a grade of 69%. :) Nice.
