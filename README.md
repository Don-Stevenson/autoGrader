# AutoGrader

## Hooray, Marking Hell is Finally Over!

#

## About:

#### AutoGrader is a simple, command line driven tool that takes away all the stress and agony of marking papers away for good.

#### _At last! You can relax again!_

#### Simply open the command line, run the script and get back to what you _really_ _want_ to be doing with your life, like knitting, starting to smoke cigarettes at age 46, and even contemplating the meaning of your own mortality given the chaotic and inherently meaningless nature of the universe!

#

- Autograder marks on a bell curve.
  It has the capacity to grades (from >0 to <=4, where numbers closer to 0 will produce more _higher_ grades)
  to help avoid crying students during office hours.
